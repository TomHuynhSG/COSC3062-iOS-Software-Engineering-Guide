            <h1>Basic Swift <span>Step by Step Guide</span></h1>
            <p class="intro">The goal of our first lab is to give you a sense of Swift, a new language you'll need to master. This one covers the basics, including variables and control flow, methods and properties, arrays and strings, but keep in mind that Swift handles some of the basics in a very powerful way which you will learn later.</p>
            <p class="intro">Please read the section of the <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html" target="_blank">Swift Programming Language</a> document throughout the course! We encourage scrolling through the document to understand more about Swift during the course. You'll be reading the majority of the content in 11 Â½ of the first 14 chapters listed <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/" target="_blank">Swift API Guidelines</a>, for quick reference (The Basics through the first half of Initialization, excluding Subscripts or Inheritance). During the lecture, I went through <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html" target="_blank">A Swift Tour</a> with you guys! It is a good place to get familiar with the Swift language. As you get more practice, these questions will become easier, but you will still make mistakes here and there. Feel free to be wrong and try again!</p>

                        <h3>Step 1: Create a New Playground</h3>
                        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong> First, open the Swift Playgrounds application. From the top menu bar, click on "File" and then select "New Book" (or "New Playground") to create a new project. A new playground file, typically named "My Playground," will appear. Click on it to open and start coding.</p>

                        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong> Once your new playground is open, you can begin entering your Swift code in the main editor window. To see the output of your code, click the "Run My Code" button. The results will be displayed in the console or preview area.</p>

                        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong> To keep your code organized, especially when working on different problems or sections, you can create new pages. Click the sidebar icon to view your pages. You can add a new page for each new question or part of your project. This allows you to manage your code in a structured way.</p>

                        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong> If you need to go back to the main menu to see all of your Playground files, go to the "Window" tab in the top menu bar and select "My Playgrounds". This will take you back to the screen where all your saved playgrounds are listed.</p>

                        <h3>Step 5: Share Your Playground</h3>
                        <p><strong>Instruction:</strong> When you want to share your entire Swift Playground file, which includes all the pages and code you've created, navigate to the "My Playgrounds" main menu. Right-click (or control-click) on the playground file you wish to share, and from the context menu, select "Share". You can then choose your preferred method, such as AirDrop or Email.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>During Tet holiday, big and small is a very popular dice game to play. Itâs a game of pure chance that moves quickly. Thereâs no strategy or skill involved. Also, this kind of game is played all over the world. You will try to implement the simple version of the dai siu game.</p>
                    <p>A normal dice got 6 numbers from 1 to 6. So there are two parties: the house (nhÃ  cÃ¡i - Tom) and the player (you). At the beginning of any round, you will put what you want to bet. The house will roll 3 dice at the same time. The result will be hidden from you until you pick your choice. The player will pick either Big (TÃ i) or Small (Xá»u).</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                        <li><b>Scenario 1:</b> The sum of 3 dice being from 4 to 10: You will win the amount you have bet if you choose Small. Otherwise, you will lose, the house will take your bet.</li>
                        <li><b>Scenario 2:</b> The sum of 3 dice being from 11 to 17: You will win the amount you have bet if you choose Big. Otherwise, you will lose, the house will take your bet.</li>
                        <li><b>Scenario 3:</b> If all numbers of each dice are the same like (1, 1, 1) or (4, 4, 4) then you will lose regardless of what you pick, Big or Small.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Two parties can start with any money (usually you have much less). The player can keep playing until either the house or the player runs out of money. Please try your luck to win all the money for the house.</p>

                    <p>A pair of rabbits (one male and one female) do not give birth until they are 2 months old. After 2 months old, each pair of rabbits gives birth to a pair of baby rabbits (including a male rabbit and a female rabbit) every month. How many pairs of rabbits are there after n months, and in the first month there is a pair of newborn rabbits?</p>

                    <p>In the above figure, we assume:</p>

                        <li>A pair of brown rabbits is a pair of rabbits with an age of 1 month. (not ready to give birth)</li>

                        <li>1st and 2nd month: Only 1 pair of rabbits.</li>
                        <li>The 3rd month: this pair of rabbits will give birth to a pair of baby rabbits, so this month there will be 2 pairs of rabbits.</li>
                        <li>The 4th month: only the first pair of rabbits gave birth, so at this point there are 3 pairs of rabbits.</li>
                        <li>5th month: there are two pairs of rabbits (the first pair and the rabbits are born in the third month) give birth together, so this month there are 2 + 3 = 5 pairs of rabbits.</li>
                        <li>6th month: there are three pairs of rabbits (2 pairs of rabbits first and a pair of rabbits born in the fourth month)</li>
                        <li>Both gave birth at this time, so here there are 3 + 5 = 8 pairs of rabbits.</li>

                    <h3>Fun fact about Australia ð¦ðº</h3>
                    <p>This question is inspired by the real "rabbit disaster" in Australia, which caused the largest biological invasion in history. In 1859, Thomas Austin brought 24 wild rabbits to his estate in Victoria, Australia from the UK. However, rabbits are highly efficient breeders, with a single female capable of producing dozens of children in a year. By the 1920s, there were more than 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) rabbits across Australia in all states. That is how fast a rabbit can give birth! With this large number of rabbits, they cause significant damage to crops, pastures, and natural ecosystems in Australia.</p>
